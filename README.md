 "Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)
Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that
Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible"
